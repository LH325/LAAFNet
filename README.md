# LAAFNet
We have uploaded the code and dataset in advance. Since the current code is somewhat disorganized, we are still refining and cleaning it up, and updates will be released continuously. The model is already functional, simply place the data in the checkpoint folder and configure the paths in the data_utils.py file. The main_cd.py script is used for training, while eval_cd.py is for evaluation.
# Dataset Description
